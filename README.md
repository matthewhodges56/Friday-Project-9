# Friday-Project-9
 
This project is a simple interactive GUI application using Python and Tkinter that allows users to interact with OpenAI's language models. Users can type a prompt into the input box, click a submit button to send the prompt to the model, and view the model's response in an output box.

# Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. In that file, add this code:

`key="YOUR_API_KEY"`

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.
